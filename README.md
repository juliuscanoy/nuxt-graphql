## Improvements Notes:

1. Implement Better State Management. Currently using Pinia in Vue2 format.
2. Implement Better Middleware for Authentication Token
3. Implement Validation for API calls
4. Make fully use of Nuxt3 Capabilities. It's my first time using Nuxt3 and have been using Vue2/Vue3 for a while now. So I just used whatever I have absorbed during the research and learning Nuxt3
